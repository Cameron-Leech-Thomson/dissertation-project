## [Virtual Reality Physics Exploration Application](https://cameron-leech-thomson.github.io/blog/virtual-reality-development/)

*Product created for Computer Science BSc Dissertation at the University of Sheffield.*

A virtual reality application in which the user can manipulate the effects of gravity, doppler shift, and the speed of light to solve puzzles using the relativistic effects that come about as a result of these changes. For example, a paperclip may not exert a strong enough force to activate a button, but by increasing the strength of gravity, that paperclip may have enough force to hold down the button. Alternatively, a one-time switch could be activated by throwing a paperclip at it while the speed of light is extremely low (<20m/s). The relativistic mass gained by the object will give the paperclip enough *oomph* to activate the switch.
